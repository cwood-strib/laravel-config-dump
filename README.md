# Laravel Config Dump ðŸšš

Dumps all the ENV keys that a Laravel codebase uses. This could probably be done with a clever sequence of `grep` and `uniq`, but here we are.

## Install 

```sh
composer install
```

## Usage

```
./lcd path-to-php-project
```

## Example 

For an example, you can run the script against the `data` folder.

```
./lcd data
```
